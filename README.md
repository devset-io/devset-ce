## About the Project

Devset CE (Community Edition) is an open-source tool designed to simplify testing and working with event-driven systems such as **Apache Kafka** and other compatible brokers. The goal is to help developers quickly **connect**, **explore**, and **send test messages** using reusable schemas and configurable message flows.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an early, minimal version focused on core functionality ‚Äî especially message sending and schema handling. More features are being developed continuously.

> üìò Note: Documentation is a work in progress and will be extended over time. Contributions are welcome!

## Features (Current)
- ‚úÖ **Connect to Kafka brokers** ‚Äì configure bootstrap servers and test the connection.
- ‚úÖ **Send test messages** ‚Äì manually or using configurable rules and intervals.
- ‚úÖ **Load and view schemas** ‚Äì import reusable message schemas (based on JSON).
- ‚úÖ **Create topics** ‚Äì define and create new topics directly from the UI.
- ‚úÖ **Message headers** ‚Äì configure custom headers for each message.

### Planned (Upcoming)
- ‚è≥ Edit topics (partial UI already exists)
- ‚è≥ Integration with Schema Registry
- ‚è≥ Multi-cluster support and history tracking
- ‚è≥ Visual flow editor for building advanced test scenarios

## System Requirements
- Java 21 or newer
- Access to a running Kafka cluster or compatible broker

## Installation

### From Source Code
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dominikmart/devset-ce.git
cd devset-ce

# Build the project
mvn clean install

# Run the application
java -jar application/target/devset-ce.jar
```

### From Release Package
Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/dominikmart/devset-ce/releases) section and run:
```bash
java -jar devset-ce.jar
```

## Quick Start
1. **Connect to Kafka** ‚Äì provide the bootstrap server address (e.g., `localhost:9092`)
2. **Browse or load schemas** ‚Äì define message structure via JSON Schema
3. **Send messages** ‚Äì select topic, attach schema, and test delivery

## Project Structure
- `adapters/` ‚Äì connectors to external systems (Kafka, etc.)
- `application/` ‚Äì JavaFX + Spring Boot entry point and logic
- `domain/` ‚Äì domain model and core business logic
- `configuration/` ‚Äì configuration, services, and technology stack

## Flow Editor
The flow editor allows you to build complex test scenarios by defining message sequences, conditions, and transformations. This feature is in early development and will be expanded in future releases.
